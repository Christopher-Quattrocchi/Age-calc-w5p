The gh-pages branch exists, but I don't recommend using it to use the project

## Description
Use JS, CSS, HTML, Jest, NPM, Lint and Git to make a page that calculates age and how long until your next birthday on various planets
## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone project_
* _Navigate to project directory
* _npm install_ (To install dependencies)
* _npm run start_ (package.json is set up in a way that this will automatically build the project; you can just enter npm run start to display the page)

## Known Bugs

* _There is no input validation, you must enter input that makes sense for the output to make sense_
